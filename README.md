# Root Cause analysis using data blending techniques in Power BI

### Automate dashboard to visualize 3 different product lines to get insights in PowerBi

**Issue:**  The current reporting process was done using excel which takes the Senior Engineer at Tijuana,Mexico about 6 hours of his time every week, and the worst part is that the engineer had to work during weekends just to create this report. Who likes working on weekends? â˜¹

So I came acrross this workflow for this problem

_**Key takeaways from this project**_

I was responsible for deploying this automated system and training senior engineering team members. The deployment of the system required careful planning and coordination with different teams to ensure a smooth transition. <br> I had to ensure that all necessary systems and infrastructure were in place before deployment, and that the system was tested thoroughly to eliminate any potential issues. <br> This required me to have a strong understanding of the system and its functionality, as well as the ability to communicate effectively with team members who may have different levels of technical expertise. <br> I was able to work with a diverse team of professionals and learn from their experiences, and I believe that the skills and knowledge I gained will be valuable in future projects. <br>
Also, during this process I was able to save time for someone who had been doing these manual work for years :)
